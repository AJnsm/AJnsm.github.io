<h3>NOTE</h3>

I have recently started a new position at the University of Amsterdam. This means that this page is now slightly out-of-date, but will be updated soon. Stay tuned...

<h3>Higher-order interactions</h3>

Complex networks are everywhere, and commonly represented as graphs of nodes with interactions. Why graphs? Why restrict interactions to pairwise? Combinatorial and higher-order dependence structures are ubiquitous in Nature, and I'm interested in how to use them to understand complex systems.

<h3>Stator: Higher-order genetic interactions and cells states</h3>


I study the role of *higher-order* interactions in particular in biomedicine, and developed a method called [Stator](https://github.com/AJnsm/Stator) to use such higher-order interactions among molecules to identify new cell states hiding in single-cell transcriptomic data sets. [Here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572232), we used this to find future fates of embryonic neurons, and liver cancer states that are prognostic of patient survival.

<h3>Interactions and information theory</h3>

[I've also shown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04440) how such higher-order interactions are centrally located in the landscape of higher-order information theory. While at the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences</a> I looked at the role of higher-order information theory in other complex systems, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06454" target="_blank">n-qubit quantum circuits</a>.
