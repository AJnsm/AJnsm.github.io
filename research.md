Complex networks are everywhere, and commonly represented as graphs of nodes with interactions. Why graphs? Why restrict interactions to pairwise? 

I investigate the role of *higher-order* interactions Nature. In my PhD, I developed a method to use higher-order interactions among genes to identify new cell states hiding in single-cell RNA-seq data sets (paper appearing soon). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04440" target="_blank">Here</a> I showed how such higher-order interactions are centrally located in the landscape of higher-order information theory. 

I am currently a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences</a>, where I look at the role of higher-order information theory in other complex systems, such as n-qubit quantum circuits.
