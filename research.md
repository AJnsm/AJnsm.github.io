This is a brief summary of some of the things I work on. You can find my latest publications with some tl;dr's [here](/publications/).

### Foundations and Applications of Emergence
There is a lot to learn about emergence and complex systems, and everyone uses their own language. My approach is:

<br> 
- Algebraic 
    - Algebra comes from the Arabic "al-jabr" which means something like 'bringing parts together'. That makes it a good language for talking about complex systems.
- Computational
    - Everything I do gets implemented in code at one point.
- Compositional
    - I like thinking about hierarchies, categories, and *openness*

<br>
A lot of this comes together in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423), which presents a unified perspective on `higher-order' interactions in complex systems. It turns out that across the sciences, interactions among parts of a system can be described by a common mathematical structure, based on a certain compositional/algebraic view of the world. This turns out to be very useful! Stay tuned...

### Information theory and Biology
Information theory is a natural bridge between the physical and living systems. I am specifically interested in some extensions of Shannon's theory, such as [information decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06224), [higher-order information theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04440), and [quantum information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06454). I've applied this to brains, genes, magnets, worms, qubits, Bach's chorales, and more...

### Stator: Higher-order genetic interactions and cells states
I developed a software package called [Stator](https://github.com/AJnsm/Stator) to use higher-order interactions among RNA molecules to identify new cell states hiding in single-cell transcriptomic data sets. [Here](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44320-024-00074-1), we used this to find future fates of embryonic neurons, and liver cancer states that are prognostic of patient survival.
