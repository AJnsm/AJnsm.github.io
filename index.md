			I am a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh, working remotely from Berlin. My background is in theoretical physics, but my current work focuses on genetics, interactions, and causality.  I use ideas and techniques from physics to think about <a href="/research">networks of interacting genes</a>.

			I have noticed that I think better when I imagine an audience, so I will use the <a href="/blog"> blog </a> as an extension of my brain, and hopefully fill it with my thoughts on interesting ideas. I also tend to get distracted by completely unrelated projects a lot. Some of those I've listed <a href="/projects">here</a>.
