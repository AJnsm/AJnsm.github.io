			I am a scientist at the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/jjost/research.html" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences</a>, and also affiliated to the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/quantum-informatics" target="_blank">Quantum Informatics group at the University of Edinburgh</a>.<br>
			<br>
			I combine intuition from physics, knowledge from biology, and techniques from mathematics, to think about genes 🧬 information theory 💾 and quantum computers ⚛️. More info on my research <a href="/research">here</a>
