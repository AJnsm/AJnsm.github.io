<p class="main-col66 bottom-5">I could not find a video of an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model" target="_blank">Ising model</a> online, online simulations. So I built one. It's not really an Ising model, as the 'spins' are continuous, but it shows interesting behaviuour nonetheless. There are clear waves of motion visible that propagate along the magnets. Are these the goldstone bosons associated with a symmetry of the ground state?</p>



<h2 class="main-col66"> Bees </h2>

<p class="main-col66 bottom-1">I started keeping bees at <a href="http://annastuinenruigte.nl/en/welcome/" target="_blank">Anna's tuin en ruigte</a>, a public permaculture garden in Amsterdam. When I moved to Scotland, the bees moved to my grandmother's garden. </p>

<h2 class="main-col66"> Olfactory distillation </h2>

<p class="main-col66 bottom-1">I worked in the <a href="https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/284175/distillation-101" target="_blank">brewery of Mediamatic</a>. I designed and built a bespoke still to compactify their beer, and aid in olfactory research. By making the still a closed system, and putting a vacuum pump downstream from the condenser, I tried to distill at low pressures to see if I could preserve more odours. While I was able to produce marvelous moonshine by electrostatic fermentation, I could not reach low enough pressures to really notice a difference.</p>

<p class="main-col66 bottom-1">By growing a fungus over different legumes, you can get very funky tempeh. I've been growing some in petri dishes.</p>
