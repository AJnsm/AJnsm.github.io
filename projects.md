<h2> Artificial aesthetics </h2>
<p>OpenAI's AI system DALLE2 seems to be able to understand abstract visual languages. I explored prompts mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel" target="_blank"><b>Ernst Haeckel</b></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher" target="_blank"><b>M.C. Escher</b></a> to understand how <a href="https://twitter.com/Abelaer/status/1565621179431485441" target="_blank"><b>symmetry</b></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Abelaer/status/1567168633935200257" target="_blank"><b>impossible geometry</b></a> are captured by DALLE2.

<h2> Mycorrhizal transplantations </h2>
<p>Some trees got cut off from their neighbours by a road. I worked with the Bio-Design lab at <a href="https://www.ascus.org.uk" target="_blank"><b>Ascus</b></a> to bring these trees back in infochemical contact with their neighbours through <a href="/assets/Myco_transplant_small.pdf" target="_blank"><b>a series of mycorrhizal transplantations</b></a>.

<h2> Standaard Afwijking </h2>
<p>I run <a href="https://www.instagram.com/standaardafwijking" target="_blank"><b>an instagram account</b></a> where I collect photos of probability distrubution in the wild that say something about humans. Please send me yours!

<h2> Ising Model </h2>
<p>I <a href="/assets/mscThesis.pdf" target="_blank"><b>really</b></a> like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model" target="_blank">Ising model</a>. I could not find a video of a physical version online, only simulations. So I built one out of magnets. It's not really an Ising model, as the 'spins' are continuous angles, but it shows interesting behaviour nonetheless. There are clear waves of motion visible that propagate along the chain. Are these goldstone bosons associated with an (approximate) U(1) symmetry of the ground state?</p><br>

<h2> Bees </h2>

<p class="">I started keeping bees at <a href="http://annastuinenruigte.nl/en/welcome/" target="_blank">Anna's Tuin en Ruigte</a>, a public permaculture garden in Amsterdam. When I moved to Scotland, the bees moved to my grandmother's garden. </p><br>

<h2> Art and design </h2>

<p> Before physics, I was in art school, and I've made attempts at reconciling the two. I've made an installation based on fireflies that was exhibited on <a href="https://intothegreatwideopen.nl/programmaonderdeel/noctiluca"> a Dutch art and music festival</a>, and a analog-to-digital music box with projections of growing leafs that were exhibited in the <a href="https://www.kunstraumkreuzberg.de/"> Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien</a> in Berlin, and the <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2016-bridges-conference/abel-jansma">Bridges 2016 conference</a> in Finland.</p>

<h2> Olfactory distillation </h2>
<p>I worked in the <a href="https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/284175/distillation-101" target="_blank">brewery of Mediamatic</a>. I designed and built a bespoke still to compactify their beer, and aid in olfactory research. By making the still a closed system, and putting a vacuum pump downstream from the condenser, I tried to distill at low pressures to see if I could preserve more odours. While I was able to produce marvelous moonshine by electrostatic fermentation, I could not reach low enough pressures to really notice a difference. I presented some work on this at an <a href="https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/367770/the-aroma-lab-edition">Odorama</a>.</p><br>

<h2> Tempeh </h2>
<p>By growing a fungus over different legumes, you can get very funky tempeh. I've been growing some in petri dishes.</p><br>

<h2 > The Krullevaar 1 </h2>
<p>I designed and built a large quadcopter from aluminium, controlled by open source flight control software. It was a lot of fun, but quite dangerous, so I did not fly with it a lot. </p>

<h2 > School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe </h2>
<p>At the summer school of Physical Computing at the School of Ma, I built and battled my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAdLcie-kP0" target="_blank">remote-controlled robot</a>. </p>
