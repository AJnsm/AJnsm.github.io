<p class="main-col66 bottom-1">I started keeping bees at <a href="http://annastuinenruigte.nl/en/welcome/" target="_blank">Anna's tuin en ruigte</a>, a public permaculture garden in Amsterdam. When I moved to Scotland, the bees moved to my grandmother's garden. </p>

<h2 class="main-col66"> Olfactory distillation </h2>

<p class="main-col66 bottom-1">I worked in the <a href="https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/284175/distillation-101" target="_blank">brewery of Mediamatic</a>. I designed and built a bespoke still to compactify their beer, and aid in olfactory research. By making the still a closed system, and putting a vacuum pump downstream from the condensator, I tried to distill at low pressures to see if I could preserve more odours. While I was able to produce marvelous moonshine by electrostatic fermentation, I could not reach low enough pressures to really notice a difference.</p>
