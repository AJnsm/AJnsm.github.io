## Currently

PhD candidate in precision medicine and theoretical physics at the University of Edinburgh. We think about higher order genetic interactions in single-cell data, and how these interactions relate to cell type and state. 

- **Supervisors:** Chris Ponting & Ava Khamseh (Institute of Genetics and Cancer), Luigi Del Debbio (Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics)
- **Slogan:** The cybergenetic semantics of cell state
- **Research Interests:** Genetic systems biology • Causality & cybernetics • Higher-order information theory • Physics of machine learning • Category theory & universality • the Human Cell Atlas
