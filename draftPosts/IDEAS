MISC:
- emergence, strong and weak, and cybernetics. Top down causation is only there when we prefer theories that are good explanations, a la deutsch, since then high-level concepts like thoughts, or evolution, can truly exist and affect low-level things. I think I agree with Deutsch on this though, so I tend to believe in top-down causation, i guess. Is that the same as strong emergence? I guess not, since td-caus. does not mean that the high-level phenomena can not be deduced from low-level. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262299/)
