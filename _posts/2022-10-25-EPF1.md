## [2022.10.18] Initial note
Initial idea: discuss the usage of the [Open Game engine](https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-games-hs) with Barnabé Monnot. A demo is presented from 3:51 on [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v3Fj1GQ0aPI).

**Relevant background material**:
- [Bayesian Open Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656), 
- [Composing games into complex institutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05318.pdf)
- [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
- There seem to be some examples based on staking [here](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/tree/master/src/Examples/Staking), but I do not really know what they implement. 
<br><br>

## [2022.10.20] First meeting
- Had first discussion with Barnabé Monnot
- More precise plan: What do MEV strategies look like in the open games framework, and how do they interact. That is: given an open game description of a contract, how should we think about the strategies of the users and block builders. I could start with a simple toy system and see where that leads me.
<br><br>
**Challenges**
- How to go from smart contract to open game? The *Clockwork Finance* framework seems like a nice approach:
    - [Background paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04347.pdf)
    - [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kushalbabel/status/1438511507508137987)
    - [Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n52xBSk2TSs)
    - [Discussion (from 26:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3GOGesPKlw)
    - This uses the *K*-framework. 
        - [Very long introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQMi_N42B8)
        - [very short introduction:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSaIKHQOo4c)
- Who are the players in this game? 
    - Users: send transactions that can lead to MEV opportunities
    - Builders: Have the power to extract MEV
    - Contracts: also have 'strategies'--can respond to states and contexts
    - The MEV calculator/searcher? Or should I assume the existence of an MEV oracle?
    - Can all of these be abstracted into "Accounts"?
- What do MEV strategies actually look like in practice? 
- Install Haskell and the Open Game engine

<br><br>

### [2022.10.24] First test with the `open-games-hs` engine
- Installed Haskell Tool Stack
- Forked the open game engine from [https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs)
- There [seems to be a bug](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5232) in the Haskell tool stack that made `stack run` execute the wrong code. I submitted a PR to fix this [here](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/pull/8). With this fix, all seems to run as it should. 

In addition, I opened an interactive `ghci` session, and tested the simplest case: a single decision game where the optimum is choosing the number 5, with a squared error utility loss. This worked as it should:
<br><br>


```
> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 2)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are NOT in equilibrium. Consider the following profitable deviations:

Player: player1
Optimal Move: 5.0
Current Strategy: fromFreqs [(2.0,1.0)]
Optimal Payoff: 0.0
Current Payoff: -9.0
Observable State: ()
Unobservable State: "((),())"
 --other game--
 --No more information--
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----

> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 5)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----
```
<br><br>
As a sanity check, changing the payoff function to the constant 0-function by setting `payoffFunction peak dec = - 0*(peak - dec)**2` in `Decision.hs` results in every strategy being an equilibrium:
<br><br>
```
> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 5)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----

> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 2)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----

> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 1)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----

> λ: isOptimalSingleDecisionVerbose (pureIdentity 0)
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME:
----Analytics end----
```

**Next steps**
- Read Clockwork Finance paper
- Understand MEV strategies
- Implement simple system in Open Game engine myself

## [2022.10.26] Meeting notes
Had meeting with Barnabé, Philipp, and Fabrizio to discuss scope, relevance, and ideas. 

**Some takeaways**
- Relevance: The ultimate dream is to have fully automated (de)compiling of EVM bytecode to OG engine DSL, where MEV strategy compositionality can be immediately verified. That is a long-term vision, but finding the 'right' way to model contracts with OGs is an important step. 
- Central challenge: at which level to model the games; who are the agents? How 'intelligent' are they? Can they reason about other agents? What are the types at the wires? TXs, EVM states, contracts?
- Options:
    1. Composing games means composing contracts through transactions -> games are contracts, strategies are essentially the contract code. 
    2. The strategies are different choices of block composition, so games are choices of block construction -> composition is chain construction(?)
    3. (speculative) ['smart transactions'](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/smart-transactions/?tab=YouTube) are the games, and composition is block construction. 

- One advantage: mempool is public, so not much private information reasoning. 
- Concensus and execution should be kept completely separate for now
- They have draft implementations in the Open Game engine of the model contracts presented in the [Clockword Finance framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04347.pdf)
    - Uniswap
    - Maker
    - Bet

**Background questions**
- What is MEV *really*?
    - How much MEV can be extracted form a blockchain with 1 tx per block?
    - Once we have the right formalism for treating MEV strats as games, can we define MEV in a precise way, as a fundamental property of the formalism (e.g. categorified MEV?)
    - [This is MEV](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/this-is-mev/?tab=YouTube)
    - [This is not MEV](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/6/this-is-not-mev/?tab=YouTube)
- So far we've only discussed sequential composition. What about parallel? e.g. bots competing for attacks at the same timea. 
- Does the compositionality show new structure? E.g. Is doing a bunch of arbitrages on different AMMs equivalent to a standard arbitrage on a composed AMM (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07371v1)? Is this 'obvious' from the string diagrams?

**TODO**
- Dive in the examples that are implemented. Do I understand what is happening? Can I run the standard analysis? Can I draw the string diagrams? 
- Probably start with the simplest: a single uniswap call. [ref1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14021.pdf) [ref2](https://notes.ethereum.org/@barnabe/HkYnvSqMO)
