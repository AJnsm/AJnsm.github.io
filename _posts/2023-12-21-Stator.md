In my [PhD thesis](../assets/JansmaAbel_PhDThesis_corrected.pdf), I developed a method and software package to infer interactions and cell states from gene expression data. Both the [software](https://github.com/AJnsm/Stator) and the [research](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572232) are now published!

The software is called Stator, and comprises the [Stator Nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/AJnsm/Stator), as well as a bespoke [Shiny app](https://shiny.igc.ed.ac.uk/MFIs/) developed by Yuelin Yao.
