I was completely mesmerised by the swallows in Portugal, and while playing around with some origami paper, I came up with this simple design for an origami swallow. It is based on the famous 'crane base' (steps 1-7), and implements many folds used in the standard Orizuru crane (inside-reverse folds for the wings, narrowing the bottom two flaps, etc). 

## Step 1 

Two diagonal valley folds, and two horizontal mountain folds.

## Step 2 

Push the diagonals together along the valley folds.

## Step 3 

Flatten, keep the open sides at the bottom.

## Step 4 

Fold the open edges inwards (on both sides).

<br>


## Step 5 

Fold the top triangle down.

<br>


## Step 6 

Undo the previous fold.

<br>


## Step 7 

Open the two flaps and fold the inside triangle up (on both sides).

<br>


## Step 8 

Open the four sides.

<br>


## Step 9 

Close and flatten along the edges previously not touching.

<br>


## Step 1.

 Fold along the bottom diagonals.

<br>


## Step 1.

 Open the two wings with an inside reverse fold. This is a free fold that determines the angle of the wings.

## Step 1.

 Fold open the v-shaped tail. This is another free fold.
