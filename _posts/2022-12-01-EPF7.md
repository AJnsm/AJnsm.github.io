[Last week]({% post_url 2022-11-29-EPF6 %}), I analysed the BigPlayer rule for cake-cutting using the Open Game engine, and found equilibria at proportional distributions for $n \in \[2, 3, 4\]$. Here follows a handwavy proof of general fairness.

<br>

**Notation** Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$ be the total number of players, and let $P_i$ be the name of player $i$. Let $C>0$ be the total size of the cake to be shared among all players. 

<br>


**Definition** The BigPlayer rule is defined by the following rules:
1. $P_1$ cuts the pie in two pieces, resulting in two pieces of sizes $(a_1 C, (1-a_1 )C)$, where $a_1 \in \[0, 1\]$. 
2. $P_2$ chooses one of the two pieces.
3. If there are any players left who did not play yet: Let $P_\text{BP}$ be the player who ended up with the largest of the two pieces that resulted from the last cut. $P_\text{BP}$ then has to cut their piece in two.
4. A player that did not play yet chooses one of $P_\text{BP}$'s pieces. 
5. Move to 3 if there are any players that have not played yet. 

<br>

**Theorem** Cutting a cake of size $C$ with the BigPlayer rule has a Nash equilibrium at a proportional distribution with $n-1$ cuts where each of $n$ players gets a contiguous piece of size $C/n$, as long as players cannot cut the cake exactly in half. 

<br>

*(proof)* The $n=1$ case is trivial. The $n=2$ case reduces to the game 'I cut you choose', so inherits the proportional equilibrium. The proof then follows by induction: Assume that the $n$-player implementation has a proportional equilibrium, then consider the game with $n+1$ players. In this game, a proportional first cut would result in two pieces of respective sizes $(\frac{C}{n+1}, \frac{Cn}{n+1})$. If $P_1$ chooses to make this cut, then $P_1$ or $P_2$ ends up either with a piece of size $\frac{C}{n+1}$, or a piece of size $\frac{Cn}{n+1}$ that then has to be shared with $n$ other players. Since the $n$-player game has a proportional equilibrium, whoever ends up with the piece of size $\frac{Cn}{n+1}$, and all remaining players, will thus also get a proportional piece of size $\frac{C}{n+1}$. 

However, consider possible deviations from an initial proportional cut. If $P_1$ chooses to deviate by $\epsilon>0$, then the resulting pieces are of size $(\frac{C}{n+1} + \epsilon, \frac{Cn}{n+1} - \epsilon)$. If the second piece is the biggest, then $P_\text{BP}$ ends up with a piece of size $\frac{Cn}{n+1} - \epsilon$, to be shared among $n$ players. The proportional equilibrium of the $n$-player game would then give $P_\text{BP}$ and each remaining player a piece of size $\frac{C}{n+1} - \epsilon/n$, which is smaller than true proportionality among $n+1$ players. Since $P_2$ profits from choosing the first piece they will do so, making this deviating first cut not profitable for $P_1$. Similar reasoning holds if $\epsilon$ is so large that the first piece becomes the biggest: $P_2$ can always force $P_1$ to end up with a smaller piece while profiting themselves. 
The only special case is a cut that leaves two pieces of equal size. In this case, the BigPlayer rule cannot decide who the next player should be and the game is undefined. In fact, any rule that assigns one of two equal pieces to a player necessarily destroys the equilibrium for any $n>2$. 

However, if perfect $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ cuts are not allowed, the equilibrium of proportional distribution thus holds for $n+1$ players as long as it holds for $n$ players. Since it holds for $n=2$, it holds in general. $\square$

<br>

Note that this rule does not easily generalise to situations where players have different valuation functions, since the choice of $P_\text{BP}$ then depends on the valuation used. Another limiting factor is that the reasoning each player needs to do in order to decide on the cut that maximises their payoff grows quickly with the number of players involved.

While it might seem artificial to restrict the cuts to non-equal divisions, I would argue that this is not very limiting. In practice, the only reason to cut the cake into two equal parts would be to sabotage the game, since an almost-equal division leads to a very bad outcome for the cutting player. Only the final two players will want to share the cake equally, and can do so without breaking the game, since no BigPlayer needs to be selected. Moreover, in practice it is often easier to decide which of two pieces is bigger than to divide a piece into two equal parts. For example, a perfect $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ division of an actual cake is impossible even with a very sharp knife, while deciding which of the two pieces is bigger is easy, for example by using a scale.
