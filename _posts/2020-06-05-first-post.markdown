Right, so I now have this page. It's my personal webpage, blog, online CV, extended brain. I don't know yet what will be on it, so I'm operating under the working-title *Curiomics*. The name is inspired by the trend in biology to put the suffix -[omics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics) behind observable things to describe the act of looking at them as a whole, or across their full range. That is my ambition/fear for this page, that it will provide a bird's eye view of things that tickle my curiosity, hopefully motivated by some vague sense of coherence.
