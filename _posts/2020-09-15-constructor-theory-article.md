There is this theory, mainly developed by <a href="http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk" target="_blank">David Deutsch</a> at Oxford, called <a href="http://constructortheory.org" target="_blank">Constructor Theory</a>. I tickles my brain in all the right ways; It's a fundamental theory of reality, but not reductionistic in the way that other fundamental theories in physics are (like quantum field theory). I think it can be best compared to the law of energy conservation, a type of meta-law. 


The theory treats composition as a fundamental property of constructors and substrates, and I have a feeling it can be well formulated in the language of category theory, or a resource theory (even though Deutsch himself disagrees with this), and I am thinking about this off and on. There will most likely be a follow up post on this.

I was recently interviewed by Logan Chipkin who was writing an article for Gizmodo on constructor theory. You can find the article <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-meta-theory-of-physics-could-explain-life-the-univer-1844806293" target="_blank">here</a>. I think it gives a very good overview of the theory, its potential, and criticism, and can hopefully get more people excited.
