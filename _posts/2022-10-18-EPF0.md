I have been granted an [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/09/01/ethereum-protocol-fellowship-third), which provides me with a mentor who can help me get started on a project related to the Ethereum system. In my case, I have been interested in [compositional game theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641) for a while now, and by extension its implementation in the [Open Game engine](https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-games-hs). I believe that this engine can become a very powerful tool for protocol design and analysis---the focus of the [Robust Incentives group](https://ethereum.github.io/rig/)---so I will focus on analysing some parts of the protocol using this framework.
