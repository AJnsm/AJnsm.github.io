<br>

In this post, I will outline a way in which the equilibrium analysis from the Open Game engine can be used to come up with profitable strategies for a block proposer on the Ethereum blockchain, either by re-ordering the transactions in the block, or by inserting their own. I will consider two sources of MEV here, inspired by the [Clockwork Finance paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04347). First, I will consider transactions to a Uniswap-like exchange, that exchanges two tokens according to the [constant product rule](https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf). By ordering such transactions, the block proposer can profitably manipulate the price of the tokens. Second, such price manipulation can be made even more profitable by placing a bet on the exchange rate offered by the Uniswap contract. To be able to analyse both these scenarios, I will model a blockchain with just two player accounts, $p_0$ and $p_1$, and two contract accounts: Uniswap and Bet. Most of the complexity will be captured in Haskell functions, and the Open Game engine is only used to search for profitable strategies for the block proposer $p_0$. 

<br>

Let's first define some useful data types. I assume there exist only two tokens: `A` and `B`, both of which can be held in fractional amounts. An `Account` has an integer `AccountID`, and can hold amounts of both tokens. A transaction `Tx` specifies a sender and receiver ID, and how much of which token is sent. A block is simply modelled as a list of transactions:

<br>

```haskell
data Token = A | B
  deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)
type TokenAmount = Double
type AccountID = Int

-- ID, amount A, amount B
type Account = (AccountID, TokenAmount, TokenAmount)

type AccountStates = [Account]

-- Sender, Receiver, Token, Amount
-- Should this also have a data field?
type Tx = (AccountID, AccountID, Token, TokenAmount)

type TxBlock = [Tx]
```

<br>

Let's further define two useful functions to find the recipient of a transaction and an account's balance:

<br>

```haskell
getReceiver :: Tx -> AccountID
getReceiver (_,receiver, _, _) = receiver

balance :: Account -> Token -> TokenAmount
balance (userID, amountA, amountB) token
    | token==A = amountA
    | otherwise =  amountB
```

<br>

A call to the Uniswap contract is a map from the current state and a transaction to a new state. To generate the new state from the old one, I use a lens on the list, imported from `Control.Lens`. 

<br>

```haskell
uniSwapExchange :: AccountStates -> Tx -> AccountStates
-- Old state -> transaction -> new state
-- Use lenses to 'modify' account states
-- If the user does not have sufficient funds, simply propagate the old state.
uniSwapExchange accountStates (userID, uniSwapID, token, tokenAmount)
   | userbalanceInsufficient = accountStates
   | otherwise = accountStates & (ix userID) .~ userUpdateA2B & (ix uniSwapID) .~ uniswapUpdate
  where
   user_bal = balance (accountStates!!userID)
   userbalanceInsufficient = user_bal token < tokenAmount
   uniSwap_bal = balance (accountStates!!uniSwapID)
   dA = uniSwap_bal A * tokenAmount / (uniSwap_bal B + tokenAmount) 
   dB = uniSwap_bal B * tokenAmount / (uniSwap_bal A + tokenAmount) 
   userUpdateA2B = if token == A
                     then (userID, user_bal A - tokenAmount, user_bal B + dB)
                     else (userID, user_bal A + dA, user_bal B - tokenAmount)
   uniswapUpdate = if token == A
                     then (uniSwapID, uniSwap_bal A + tokenAmount, uniSwap_bal B - dB)
                     else (uniSwapID, uniSwap_bal A - dA, uniSwap_bal B + tokenAmount)
```

<br>

Similarly, a call to the Bet contract transforms an old state into a new one, but it also needs an `AccountID` that specifies which contract should be used as a price oracle. It further needs the price that would trigger a win for the better. Crucially, both of these are a property of the contract, and not set by the transaction that actually places a bet of a certain amount. I've implemented it so that when the user wins a bet in token T, they receive the full T-balance of the betting contract.


<br>

```haskell
betOnExchange :: AccountStates -> AccountID -> Double -> Tx -> AccountStates
-- Old state, price oracle, bet threshold, bet amount, new state
-- Use lenses to 'modify' account states
betOnExchange accountStates oracleID ratio (userID, betID, betToken, betAmount)
   | (userbalanceInsufficient || betAmount<=0) = accountStates
   | ((uniSwap_bal A)/(uniSwap_bal B) >= ratio) = accountStates & (ix userID) .~ userUpdate_userWin & (ix betID) .~ betUpdate_userWin
   | ((uniSwap_bal A)/(uniSwap_bal B) <  ratio) = accountStates & (ix userID) .~ userUpdate_userLose & (ix betID) .~ betUpdate_userLose
  where
   uniSwap_bal = balance (accountStates!!oracleID)
   bet_bal = balance (accountStates!!betID)
   user_bal = balance (accountStates!!userID)
   userbalanceInsufficient = user_bal betToken < betAmount

   -- The prize is either the amount bet, or the remaining balance if that is less
   prize = minimum [betAmount, balance (accountStates!!betID) betToken]

   userUpdate_userWin = if betToken==A 
                           then (userID, user_bal A + prize, user_bal B) 
                           else (userID, user_bal A, user_bal B + prize)
   betUpdate_userWin = if betToken==A 
                           then (betID, bet_bal A - betAmount, bet_bal B)
                           else (betID, bet_bal A, bet_bal B - betAmount)
   userUpdate_userLose = if betToken==A
                           then (userID, user_bal A - betAmount, user_bal B)
                           else (userID, user_bal A, user_bal B - betAmount)
   betUpdate_userLose = if betToken==A 
                           then (betID, bet_bal A + betAmount, bet_bal B)
                           else (betID, bet_bal A, bet_bal B + betAmount)
```

<br>

That is all the needed contract complexity. The only thing needed now is to initialise the accounts and make sure the right internal code gets triggered when a transaction is made to a contract account (in fact, I will only worry about contract-calling transactions here). 
Let's initialise the accounts of two players and the two contracts with the following balances:

<br>

```haskell
p0_ac = (0, 10, 10)
p1_ac = (1, 10, 10)
uniswap_ac = (2, 100, 100)
bet_ac = (3, 100, 100)

initAccounts :: AccountStates
initAccounts = [p0_ac, p1_ac, uniswap_ac, bet_ac]
```

<br>
I will interpret $p_0$ as the block proposer. Since, in this limited example, $p_0$ does not actually care who makes the other contract calls, one other player, $p_1$, should be sufficient. I then specify how each contract call should be executed, specifying the account with index 2 (the Uniswap account) as the price oracle for the betting contract, and setting the winning threshold at a token ratio of 1.1. 

<br>

```haskell
executeTx :: AccountStates -> Tx -> AccountStates
executeTx states tx
   | getReceiver tx == 2 = uniSwapExchange states tx
   | getReceiver tx == 3 = betOnExchange states 2 1.1 tx
   | otherwise = states
```

<br>
Executing a whole block of transactions is then simply a `foldl` of executing each transaction, since the accounts get updated each time:

<br>

```haskell
executeBlock :: AccountStates -> TxBlock -> AccountStates
executeBlock accountStates_init block = foldl executeTx accountStates_init block
```

<br>

There are many definitions of MEV, and [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qPpiMDz_hw) [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc5zxOonT0A) [disagree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04347) on the [right](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234) [definition](https://writings.flashbots.net/formalization-mev). Here, I will simply choose Token `A` as the relevant holder of value (also called the *numéraire*), so the final `A` balance determines the payoff, which is equal to the MEV:

<br>

```haskell
blockPayoff :: AccountStates -> TxBlock -> AccountID -> Payoff
-- Old state, block, payoff for user "userID"
blockPayoff initStates block userID = newBalance - oldBalance
  where
   newBalance = balance ((executeBlock initStates block)!!userID) A
   oldBalance = balance (initStates!!userID) A
```

<br>

To analyse the extractable value by the proposer $p_0$, let's imagine a mempool with transactions in which both players exchange tokens `A` and `B` in both directions. 

<br>

```haskell
tx1 = (getAccountID p0_ac, getAccountID uniswap_ac, A, 2.0)
tx2 = (getAccountID p1_ac, getAccountID uniswap_ac, A, 3.0)
tx3 = (getAccountID p0_ac, getAccountID uniswap_ac, B, 2.0)
tx4 = (getAccountID p1_ac, getAccountID uniswap_ac, B, 3.0)

block1 :: TxBlock
block1 = [tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4]
```

<br>

The strategy of the proposer is simply a choice of an ordering of these four transactions, which can be implemented as the (trivial) open game as follows:

<br>

```haskell
txOrderingGame  = [opengame|
   inputs    :      ;
   feedback  :      ;

   :----------------------------:
   inputs    :      ;
   feedback  :      ;
   operation : dependentDecision "proposer" (const actionSpace);
   outputs   : ordering ;
   returns   : blockPayoff initAccounts (blockPerm ordering) 0     ;
   :----------------------------:

   outputs   :      ;
   returns   :      ;
  |]
  where
   actionSpace = [0..(product [1..4]-1)]
   blockPerm = \x -> ((permutations block1)!!x)

analyseTxOrderingGame strat = generateIsEq $ evaluate txOrderingGame strat void
```

<br>

What if the proposer decides to put their interactions first, *i.e.* order the block as `[tx1, tx3, tx2, tx4]`? This corresponds to the fifth permutation, so can be analysed as follows:

<br>

```haskell
λ: analyseTxOrderingGame $ choosePerm 5
```
```
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are NOT in equilibrium. Consider the following profitable deviations: 

Player: proposer
Optimal Move: 1
Current Strategy: fromFreqs [(5,1.0)]
Optimal Payoff: 0.15964740450538706
Current Payoff: 0.03920031360250853
 --other game-- 
 --No more information--
 NEWGAME: 
----Analytics end----
```

<br>

It can be seen that there is a bit of 'profit' using this ordering, though not a lot. Using the first permutation, *i.e.* `[tx2, tx1, tx3, tx4]`, yields more than four times as much profit. This is because if both players first exchange `A` to `B`, then the price of `A` decreases, which means you get more `A` for your `B`, and so changing 2 `B` for `A` with `tx3` leaves the proposer with more `A` in total. This means that even though the engine suggests 1 as the optimal permutation, the identity permutation with index 0 should also be optimal, which indeed it is:

<br>

```haskell
λ: analyseTxOrderingGame $ choosePerm 0
```
```
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME: 
----Analytics end----
```

<br>

In fact, permutation 0 might be considered slightly better because it leaves the proposer (indexed with `!!0`) with slightly more `B`:

<br>

```haskell
λ: (executeBlock initAccounts [tx2, tx1, tx3, tx4])!!0
(0,10.159647404505387,9.849283402681461)
λ: (executeBlock initAccounts [tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4])!!0
(0,10.159647404505387,9.96078431372549)
```

<br>

However, since `B` is deemed irrelevant for the total MEV, this is not considered a profitable deviation.


Now consider the possible insertion of a transaction to the betting account. I will make this transaction a function that bets a certain amount, so that not 

<br>

```haskell
blockWithbet :: TokenAmount -> TxBlock
blockWithbet amount = [tx1, tx2, tx3, txBet amount]
```

<br>

Letting the player bet multiples of 0.1 of a full token, the full game simply becomes the composition of two choices: what to bet, and how to order, as follows

<br>

```haskell

txOrderingGame_withBet  = [opengame|
   inputs    :      ;
   feedback  :      ;

   :----------------------------:

   inputs    :      ;
   feedback  :      ;
   operation : dependentDecision "proposer" (const betAmounts);
   outputs   : betAmount ;
   returns   :  0   ;

   inputs    :      ;
   feedback  :      ;
   operation : dependentDecision "proposer" (const actionSpace);
   outputs   : ordering ;
   returns   : blockPayoff initAccounts (blockPerm ordering betAmount) 0  ;
   :----------------------------:

   outputs   :      ;
   returns   :      ;
  |]
  where
   betAmounts = [0,0.1..(balance (initAccounts!!0) A)]
   actionSpace = [0..(product [1..4]-1)]
   blockPerm = \orderChoice betAmount -> ((permutations $ blockWithbet betAmount)!!orderChoice)
```

<br>

which then also requires two separate strategies:

<br>

```haskell
betAndOrderStrat :: Double -> Int -> List '[Kleisli Stochastic () Double,
   Kleisli Stochastic () Int]
betAndOrderStrat amount orderChoice = Kleisli (\x -> playDeterministically amount) ::- Kleisli (\x -> playDeterministically orderChoice) ::- Nil

analyseTxOrderingGame_withBet strat = generateIsEq $ evaluate txOrderingGame_withBet strat void
```

<br>

To analyse this game, let's first consider the strategy of betting `4A`, and not doing any reordering:

<br>

```haskell
λ: analyseTxOrderingGame_withBet $ betAndOrderStrat 4 0
```
```
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are NOT in equilibrium. Consider the following profitable deviations: 

Player: proposer
Optimal Move: 0.0
Current Strategy: fromFreqs [(4.0,1.0)]
Optimal Payoff: 0.15964740450538706
Current Payoff: -3.840352595494613
 --other game-- 
 --No more information--
 NEWGAME: 

 Strategies are NOT in equilibrium. Consider the following profitable deviations: 

Player: proposer
Optimal Move: 17
Current Strategy: fromFreqs [(0,1.0)]
Optimal Payoff: 4.159647404505387
Current Payoff: -3.840352595494613
 --other game-- 
 --No more information--
 NEWGAME: 
----Analytics end----
```

<br>

The engine reports two profitable deviations: first of all, the proposer is better off not betting at all, since they don't win with this reordering anyway. Second, there is a more profitable ordering, the permutation indexed by 17, which corresponds to `[tx2, tx1, txBet, tx3]`. Following both these suggestions: no betting and reordering, leads to the following:

<br>

```haskell
λ: analyseTxOrderingGame_withBet $ betAndOrderStrat 0 17
```
```
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are NOT in equilibrium. Consider the following profitable deviations: 

Player: proposer
Optimal Move: 8.0
Current Strategy: fromFreqs [(0.0,1.0)]
Optimal Payoff: 8.159647404505385
Current Payoff: 0.15964740450538706
 --other game-- 
 --No more information--
 NEWGAME: 

 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME: 
----Analytics end----
```

<br>
That is, the engine recognises that with this ordering, not only does the proposer extract the same reordering MEV as before, they can now also insert their own bet in the middle, and can profit maximally by betting everything they still have:

<br>

```haskell
λ: analyseTxOrderingGame_withBet $ betAndOrderStrat 8 17
```
```
----Analytics begin----
 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME: 

 Strategies are in equilibrium
 NEWGAME: 
----Analytics end----
```

<br>

It is satisfying to see MEV directly as the payoff of this block proposer game. However, it is a bit unfortunate that all compositional structure of the transaction execution is hidden in the `foldl` application, rather than explicit composition of Open Games. A logical next step would be to implement something similar, but model each contract call as an open game (potentially just a lifted function), so that player strategies and contract calls can be represented at the same level.
